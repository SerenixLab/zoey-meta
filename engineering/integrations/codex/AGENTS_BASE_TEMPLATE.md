# Zoey Repository Instructions

Template ID: `ZOEY-CODEX-AGENTS-BASE`

Template version: `V0.3.1`

Integration: `CODEX_INTEGRATION.md` `V0.2.2`

Instantiation: starting repo-local guidance. Replace this template metadata on first projection with `Seeded from template: ZOEY-CODEX-AGENTS-BASE V0.3.0`, `Repo-local guidance: yes`, and `Canonical template equality: not claimed`. Local specialization is allowed; active engineering rules must not be weakened.

This repository contains governed non-throwaway Zoey implementation work.

## Governance Router

Before editing governed code:

1. Read `governance/ZOEY_GOVERNANCE.lock`.
2. Read the conformance-index path declared by the lock, normally `governance/CONFORMANCE.md`.
3. Identify applicable `ENG-*` rules from changed paths and change type.
4. Read only the applicable rule entries in the source artifact identified by the index: `governance/ENGINEERING_STANDARD.md`, `governance/profiles/`, or `governance/integrations/`.
5. Read cited source snapshots in `governance/sources/` when the change may alter a governed semantic contract or the rule is ambiguous.

Do not read the full standard/profile for every routine change. Use the complete conformance index as the applicability router; a missing rule row is an audit failure, not a non-applicability decision.

For each governed path you will modify, identify every more-specific `AGENTS.override.md` or `AGENTS.md` between the current working directory and the target directory that was not automatically discovered. Read those files in path order before editing the target. If the task spans differently governed paths, repeat this routing for each path.

The local governance files are derived snapshots. If they conflict with cited ADRs or registers, stop and report the conflict. Do not silently choose a weaker rule.

## Repository Map

Required when instantiated:

- `governance/`: local governance snapshots, lock, conformance ledger, and source snapshots.
- `scn001_sut_core/`: TODO describe SUT-owned implementation package.
- `scn001_eval/`: TODO describe evaluation-owned implementation package.
- `tests/`: TODO describe test layout.

## Commands

Required when instantiated:

- Format: TODO
- Code quality: TODO
- Architecture/dependency conformance: TODO
- Boundary conformance: TODO
- State integrity: TODO
- Governance integrity: TODO
- Tests: TODO

Do not describe an unrun command as passing.

## Always Apply

- `[ENG-BASE-001]` Preserve accepted Zoey decisions over implementation convenience.
- `[ENG-BASE-PUBLISH-001]` Do not rely on a sibling `meta` checkout for routine governance discovery.
- `[ENG-BASE-CONFORMANCE-001]` Do not call a rule enforced unless local evidence resolves and the declared gate runs.
- `[ENG-BASE-CONFORMANCE-002]` Every active rule needs an explicit applicability disposition.
- `[ENG-BASE-EXCEPTION-001]` Exceptions record residual risk; they do not waive accepted semantic obligations.
- `[ENG-AGENT-001]` Keep agent guidance routed through local governance and conformance evidence.
- `[ENG-HEALTH-CHANGE-001]` Keep changes focused and reviewable.
- `[ENG-HEALTH-TEST-001]` Add or update tests for behavior changes.
- `[ENG-HEALTH-API-001]` Keep public APIs minimal.
- `[ENG-CLAIM-001]` Separate engineering conformance, evaluated behavioral compatibility, and milestone acceptance.

## Boundary-Bearing Code

Boundary-bearing code includes SUT/evaluation boundaries, fixture projection, simulator routing, state mutation, references, inspection, capture, reporting, replay, restore, and claim artifacts.

Before editing it:

- identify applicable `ENG-CONF-*` rules through the lock-declared conformance index;
- read the exact active rule entries;
- read cited source snapshots when the semantic contract may change;
- preserve or update local tests/gates that enforce the rule.

## Done Means

Before completing a governed task:

1. Review the final diff for unrelated or accidental changes.
2. Identify the `ENG-*` rules touched by the final diff.
3. Run the gates required by the lock-declared conformance index for those rules.
4. Do not call an unrun check passing.
5. Report every required gate not run and why.
6. Report new residual risk.
7. Update the conformance index only when applicability, enforcement coverage, evidence identity, rule revision, gate mapping, active exception, or residual risk changed.

## Instruction Changes

If a change modifies `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.override.md`, governance lock, active profile selection, Codex integration, or instruction routing, do not continue unrelated governed implementation under stale instructions without explicitly rereading guidance or starting a fresh Codex run.

Nested `AGENTS.md` files may specialize or strengthen inherited active rules. They must not weaken, negate, bypass, or silently reinterpret them.
