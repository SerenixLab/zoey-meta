# Zoey Engineering Standard

Document version: `V0.4.0`

Status: `Draft`

Date: 2026-07-09

Release context:

- `SYSTEM_THESIS.md` `V0.3.1`
- `CANONICAL_SCENARIOS.md` `V0.2.2`
- `STATE_AND_CONTROL_MODEL.md` `V0.4.1`
- `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` `V0.2.17`
- accepted ADRs through `decisions/ADR-008-scn001-selected-slice-internal-boundary.md` `R2`

Rule-level governing sources are listed on each rule. The release context is not a substitute for rule-level source references.

## Purpose

This document defines Zoey's general engineering governance for non-throwaway implementation work.

It defines:

- how engineering rules are identified, versioned, and retired;
- how accepted decisions remain authoritative;
- how implementation repositories consume governance;
- what counts as enforcement;
- how conformance ledgers avoid stale compliance claims;
- the general code-health floor for non-throwaway work;
- claim boundaries that prevent engineering artifacts from being mistaken for evaluated behavioral compatibility or milestone acceptance.

Scenario-specific or milestone-specific obligations live in profiles, not in this base standard.

## Authority Model

This standard is a derivative engineering-conformance artifact. It does not create, redefine, or supersede semantic architecture decisions.

For every engineering rule:

```text
governing ADR/register/source = semantic authority
engineering rule = implementation consequence and required protection
implementation repo = local enforcement mechanism and evidence
```

If this standard, a profile, an integration contract, or a local governance projection conflicts with a cited governing artifact, the governing artifact wins. The affected engineering rule becomes `revalidation-required` in local ledgers until corrected or explicitly confirmed against the governing source.

Rule validity is source-bound. When a governing source revision changes, every rule that cites that source becomes revalidation-required; rules that do not cite the changed source remain valid unless the change affects them indirectly and that dependency is recorded.

## Rule Identity And Lifecycle

Engineering rule IDs are stable. Do not reuse a rule ID after removal, retirement, replacement, or semantic split.

Every canonical rule has a rule revision:

```text
ENG-HEALTH-API-001 R1
```

Editorial wording may preserve the same rule revision. A material change to the rule target, obligation, required check, expected enforcement, claim-support minimum, or failure consequence increments the rule revision. A materially different target creates a new rule ID.

Retired rules keep a tombstone that names the replacement rule or retirement reason where practical.

Rule prefixes:

| Prefix | Rule family |
| --- | --- |
| `ENG-BASE-*` | Authority, publication, conformance, profile composition, and governance lifecycle. |
| `ENG-HEALTH-*` | General code-health and implementation discipline. |
| `ENG-CONF-*` | Architecture or active-profile conformance. |
| `ENG-CLAIM-*` | Artifact labels and claim boundaries. |
| `ENG-CHANGE-*` | Open-question and decision-change triggers. |
| `ENG-AGENT-*` | Tool-neutral coding-agent governance. |

## Canonical Rule Schema

The rule catalogue is the normative engineering surface. Guidance, rationale, examples, checklists, and attack catalogues support the rules; they do not create independent binding obligations unless attached to a rule ID.

Canonical rule entries use this schema:

```text
ID:
Rule revision:
Governing sources:
Rationale references:
External behavior assumptions:
Scope:
Applies when:
Rule:
Forbidden shapes:
Required checks:
Expected mechanisms:
Expected test modes:
Promotion integration:
Minimum claim-support enforcement:
Failure consequences:
Review question:
Notes:
```

Optional fields may be omitted when not applicable. Local enforcement status is never stored in the canonical rule. It belongs only in the implementation repo's conformance ledger.

Expected mechanisms describe how protection can be implemented:

- `structural`: design makes violation impossible or materially hard;
- `static`: lint, dependency analysis, schema validation, type checks, or build rules;
- `automated-test`: deterministic tests, contract tests, negative tests, replay tests, or property tests;
- `manual-review`: explicit qualifying reviewer action and recorded outcome.

Expected test modes describe test shape:

- `positive`;
- `negative`;
- `contract`;
- `interleaving`;
- `replay`;
- `property`;
- `regression`.

Promotion integration describes where checks block work:

- `none`;
- `local`;
- `CI`;
- `required-CI`;
- `protected-branch`.

Failure consequences describe what a failure blocks:

- `merge-blocking`;
- `promotion-blocking`;
- `claim-blocking`;
- `advisory`.

## Review Actors

Manual review is not satisfied merely because text says a rule was reviewed.

Review actor classes:

- `human-review`: explicit human or project-owner-authorized reviewer action;
- `agent-review`: review performed by a coding agent or separate automated reasoning task;
- `automated-check`: non-discretionary tool result.

Unless a rule explicitly permits `agent-review`, `manual-review` means `human-review` or another project-owner-authorized reviewer. The same agent that implements a change cannot self-attest a manual-review control for that change.

A manual-review control is enforceable only when:

- the review trigger is declared;
- the review question is declared;
- the qualifying reviewer outcome is recorded;
- promotion cannot proceed without the required outcome.

Otherwise the rule is `uncovered` in the local conformance ledger.

## Conformance Ledger

Every governed non-throwaway implementation repo keeps a conformance ledger. It may be Markdown, a test manifest, CI configuration, or another inspectable local artifact.

Minimum ledger fields:

```text
Rule ID:
Rule revision:
Governing source revisions:
Applies To:
Actual mechanisms:
Actual test modes:
Promotion integration:
Status:
Failure consequences:
Local evidence:
Residual risk:
Reviewer/Owner:
Verified at:
```

Allowed local status values:

- `enforced`;
- `review-only`;
- `uncovered`;
- `revalidation-required`.

`Verified at` should identify the commit, build, configuration, or comparable evidence identity. A date may be included, but a date alone is not an integrity anchor.

## Governance Publication And Consumption

`Zoey/meta` owns canonical engineering governance. Implementation repositories consume pinned projections of the applicable standard, profiles, integration contracts, and governing source snapshots.

The preferred implementation-repo projection is:

```text
governed implementation repo
    AGENTS.md
    governance/
        ENGINEERING_STANDARD.md
        ACTIVE_PROFILE.md
        CODEX_INTEGRATION.md       if Codex is used
        ZOEY_GOVERNANCE.lock
        CONFORMANCE.md
        sources/
            OPEN_QUESTIONS.md
            ADR-*.md
```

The local governance snapshot is not a new authority. It records exactly which canonical release, active profiles, integration contracts, source snapshots, content digests, and local conformance mechanisms the repo consumes.

Do not solve governance consumption by relying on conversational memory, a developer remembering to paste rules, a sibling repository being present, or a personal global coding-agent instruction file. Repository-level governance must travel with the repository.

## Profile Composition

Profiles add scenario-specific or milestone-specific engineering rules. They may cite, strengthen, or set stricter minimum enforcement for base rules.

Profile rules must not silently weaken, redefine, or reuse existing rule IDs. Rule IDs are globally unique across canonical engineering governance.

Two active profiles with conflicting obligations create a governance conflict. Profile activation order does not resolve semantic conflict. Promotion is blocked until the conflict is resolved, explicitly scoped, or accepted through the governing decision process.

Profile IDs and profile rule IDs are not reused after retirement.

## Guidance Escalation And Pruning

Use the smallest durable control that fits the problem:

- one-off issue: review comment, local fix, or issue;
- repeated repo-local mistake: nearest applicable `AGENTS.md` or repo-local guidance;
- repeated workflow: skill or scripted review workflow;
- repeated cross-repo engineering failure: candidate `ENG-*` rule;
- selected milestone conformance pressure: active profile rule;
- semantic architecture problem: Open Question or ADR.

Do not turn every annoyance into a global rule. At profile release, major standard release, or milestone boundary, review duplicate rules, obsolete tool assumptions, mechanically enforced guidance that no longer needs prose, and rules with no observed applicability.

When a recurring failure becomes mechanically impossible, remove redundant agent prose unless it still provides useful routing context.

## Rule Catalogue

### ENG-BASE-001 - Source Authority

Rule revision: `R1`

Governing sources:

- this standard
- accepted Zoey ADRs and registers

Scope: all governed non-throwaway implementation work.

Applies when: implementation, tests, docs, reports, or governance artifacts depend on an accepted Zoey decision or unresolved-question frontier.

Rule: implementation work preserves accepted governing sources over local convenience. If code, tests, or documentation require changing an accepted source, the change is handled as a decision update or new ADR.

Forbidden shapes:

- silently implementing a different boundary than an accepted ADR;
- hiding a decision change inside code;
- claiming conformance to a rule whose cited source changed without revalidation.

Required checks:

- cite governing sources in local governance locks and conformance ledgers;
- mark affected local ledger entries `revalidation-required` when governing sources change.

Expected mechanisms:

- manual-review
- static

Expected test modes:

- contract

Promotion integration:

- local
- CI

Minimum claim-support enforcement: local ledger identifies governing source revisions for claim-bearing rules.

Failure consequences:

- promotion-blocking
- claim-blocking

Review question: does this change preserve the accepted governing source, or does it require a source update?

### ENG-BASE-002 - Rule-Level Revalidation

Rule revision: `R1`

Governing sources:

- this standard

Scope: all standard/profile releases and governed implementation repos.

Applies when: a governing source revision, rule revision, profile revision, integration contract, or local governance lock changes.

Rule: rule validity is tied to cited sources and rule revisions. When a cited source revision changes, every rule citing it becomes revalidation-required until the standard/profile is reissued or the rule is explicitly confirmed unchanged.

Forbidden shapes:

- treating the whole standard as silently valid after source changes;
- treating the whole standard as invalid when only a source-bound subset needs review;
- omitting source revisions or rule revisions from local governance locks.

Required checks:

- local governance lock lists standard version, active profile versions, active integration versions, source revisions, rule revisions, and content digests;
- conformance ledger can identify rules affected by source changes.

Expected mechanisms:

- structural
- static
- manual-review

Expected test modes:

- contract

Promotion integration:

- local
- CI

Minimum claim-support enforcement: source-bound affected rules are not `uncovered` or silently stale.

Failure consequences:

- claim-blocking

Review question: which local rules cite the changed source or rule revision?

### ENG-BASE-PUBLISH-001 - Repository Governance Projection

Rule revision: `R1`

Governing sources:

- this standard

Scope: every governed non-throwaway implementation repo.

Applies when: a repository is created, governance is synchronized, active profiles change, or non-throwaway implementation work is promoted.

Rule: each implementation repo can determine the canonical engineering-standard release it consumes, every active profile and integration contract it consumes, the governing source snapshots for active rules, and where local conformance mechanisms are recorded.

Forbidden shapes:

- relying on a sibling `meta` checkout for routine governance discovery;
- relying on a developer to remind agents or reviewers about the standard;
- manually edited local governance copies that cannot be checked against canonical snapshots.

Required checks:

- local governance snapshot or lock exists before non-throwaway implementation work is promoted;
- local projection includes applicable source snapshots or another repo-self-sufficient access mechanism;
- local lock records content digests or equivalent integrity identifiers.

Expected mechanisms:

- structural
- static
- manual-review

Expected test modes:

- contract

Promotion integration:

- local
- CI

Minimum claim-support enforcement: governance projection and source snapshots are present and integrity-checkable.

Failure consequences:

- promotion-blocking
- claim-blocking

Review question: can this repository prove which governance and source snapshots it consumes without a sibling checkout or conversation memory?

### ENG-BASE-CONFORMANCE-001 - Conformance Evidence Must Resolve

Rule revision: `R1`

Governing sources:

- this standard

Scope: local conformance ledgers, gates, tests, and governance locks.

Applies when: a rule is marked `enforced` or `review-only`, local evidence is renamed or deleted, gates are changed, or governance is audited.

Rule: a local rule may be marked `enforced` only when every required local enforcement reference resolves to an inspectable mechanism and the declared promotion integration actually executes or requires that mechanism.

Forbidden shapes:

- ledger cites a deleted test, renamed CI job, removed checker config, skipped test, or missing tool;
- ledger says `static` after the dependency checker is removed;
- gate exists but no longer runs on the protected branch or required promotion path;
- `Last checked` date is used as proof after evidence disappeared.

Required checks:

- conformance audit verifies rule IDs, rule revisions, source revisions, evidence paths, gate names, and status consistency.

Expected mechanisms:

- static
- automated-test
- manual-review

Expected test modes:

- contract

Promotion integration:

- CI
- required-CI

Minimum claim-support enforcement: no claim-supporting rule is marked enforced with missing evidence.

Failure consequences:

- promotion-blocking
- claim-blocking

Review question: does every claimed local enforcement reference still resolve and run where the ledger says it runs?

### ENG-BASE-PROFILE-001 - Profile Composition

Rule revision: `R1`

Governing sources:

- this standard

Scope: active profiles and profile rule catalogues.

Applies when: a profile is created, activated, retired, combined with another profile, or changed.

Rule: profiles may add rules, cite base rules, or strengthen minimum enforcement. They must not silently weaken, redefine, or reuse rule IDs.

Forbidden shapes:

- two active profiles define the same rule ID differently;
- a profile weakens a base rule without an accepted source change;
- profile activation order is used to resolve a semantic conflict;
- retired profile IDs or rule IDs are reused.

Required checks:

- profile rule IDs are globally unique;
- active profile conflicts are resolved or scoped before promotion.

Expected mechanisms:

- manual-review
- static

Expected test modes:

- contract

Promotion integration:

- local
- CI

Minimum claim-support enforcement: active profile set has no unresolved conflicts.

Failure consequences:

- promotion-blocking
- claim-blocking

Review question: does this profile add or strengthen rules without redefining existing obligations?

### ENG-AGENT-001 - Persistent Agent Governance

Rule revision: `R1`

Governing sources:

- this standard

Scope: repository-integrated coding agents.

Applies when: coding agents perform governed work or repository guidance is created/changed.

Rule: repository-integrated coding agents receive durable project guidance sufficient to discover active engineering rules, local enforcement, and required gates before governed changes. Agent guidance does not substitute for mechanical enforcement.

Forbidden shapes:

- relying on personal global instructions for project governance;
- requiring each prompt to restate active Zoey rules;
- treating agent guidance as proof that a rule is enforced;
- nested or specialized guidance silently weakening inherited active rules.

Required checks:

- root guidance routes agents to local governance lock and conformance index;
- specialized guidance cites relevant rule IDs where practical;
- inherited rules may be specialized or strengthened, not silently weakened.

Expected mechanisms:

- structural
- manual-review

Expected test modes:

- contract

Promotion integration:

- local

Minimum claim-support enforcement: agent guidance routes to local governance, but claim support still depends on ledger evidence.

Failure consequences:

- promotion-blocking

Review question: can an agent starting in this repo find applicable rules and gates without prompt reminders?

### ENG-HEALTH-CHANGE-001 - Focused Change

Rule revision: `R1`

Governing sources:

- this standard

Rationale references:

- Google Engineering Practices

Scope: all non-throwaway implementation changes.

Applies when: a change modifies non-throwaway code, tests, governance, build, or documentation.

Rule: each change has one primary purpose and is small enough for direct review.

Forbidden shapes:

- mixing behavior change, broad refactor, generated structure, and conformance change without explicit split rationale;
- hiding semantic changes inside formatting, renames, or cleanup.

Required checks:

- review identifies primary purpose;
- broad changes record why splitting would be riskier than combining.

Expected mechanisms:

- manual-review

Promotion integration:

- local

Minimum claim-support enforcement: claim-bearing changes identify their primary purpose and applicable rules.

Failure consequences:

- merge-blocking
- promotion-blocking

Review question: what is the primary purpose of this change, and is it small enough to review directly?

### ENG-HEALTH-TEST-001 - Behavior-Change Test Obligation

Rule revision: `R1`

Governing sources:

- this standard

Rationale references:

- Google Engineering Practices

Scope: non-throwaway behavior changes and bug fixes.

Applies when: behavior changes or a bug is fixed.

Rule: behavior changes add or update tests that fail without the change. Bug fixes include regression tests unless the failure is not reproducible in the implementation test harness or is purely editorial/build-environment-specific.

Forbidden shapes:

- changing behavior with only final-output smoke tests where boundary, state, or claim behavior is affected;
- skipping a regression test without recording the exception.

Required checks:

- test evidence or recorded exception appears in the change review.

Expected mechanisms:

- automated-test
- manual-review

Expected test modes:

- positive
- negative
- regression

Promotion integration:

- local
- CI

Minimum claim-support enforcement: behavior relevant to claims has tests or an explicit recorded exception.

Failure consequences:

- merge-blocking
- promotion-blocking

Review question: which test fails without this behavior change?

### ENG-HEALTH-TEST-002 - Test Validity

Rule revision: `R1`

Governing sources:

- this standard

Rationale references:

- Google Engineering Practices

Scope: non-throwaway tests and conformance checks.

Applies when: tests are added, changed, or used as conformance evidence.

Rule: tests exercise the narrowest meaningful boundary without mocking, precomputing, or asserting away the responsibility under test.

Forbidden shapes:

- mocking the decision being claimed;
- asserting only private implementation fields as behavior evidence;
- happy-path string snapshots as the sole evidence for state or boundary behavior;
- fixture data supplying the expected semantic result to the code under test.

Required checks:

- test review identifies the responsibility under test and what would make the test fail.

Expected mechanisms:

- automated-test
- manual-review

Expected test modes:

- contract
- negative
- regression

Promotion integration:

- local
- CI

Minimum claim-support enforcement: claim-supporting tests do not precompute the claimed behavior.

Failure consequences:

- merge-blocking
- claim-blocking

Review question: does this test actually exercise the responsibility it claims to protect?

### ENG-HEALTH-API-001 - Minimal Public API

Rule revision: `R1`

Governing sources:

- this standard

Scope: all public implementation APIs.

Applies when: public modules, functions, endpoints, exports, schemas, commands, or contracts are added or widened.

Rule: public API is minimal by default. Code is not made public solely to make tests, fixtures, or evaluation setup easier.

Forbidden shapes:

- exporting internal transition functions to let tests or harness code drive hidden semantics;
- making private state mutation public to simplify setup;
- expanding a selected-slice public boundary without a governing decision or profile rule.

Required checks:

- public API additions identify governing source and consumer;
- tests use local/internal seams rather than broadening public boundaries.

Expected mechanisms:

- static
- manual-review

Expected test modes:

- contract

Promotion integration:

- local
- CI

Minimum claim-support enforcement: public APIs used for claim evidence are declared and reviewed.

Failure consequences:

- merge-blocking
- claim-blocking

Review question: why must this be public, and which governed consumer needs it?

### ENG-HEALTH-STRUCTURE-001 - Bounded Module Responsibility

Rule revision: `R1`

Governing sources:

- this standard

Scope: top-level directories, packages, shared modules, and broad helpers.

Applies when: a new top-level area, package, shared module, or broad helper is introduced or renamed.

Rule: every top-level directory and shared module has one bounded, stateable responsibility.

Forbidden shapes:

- ambiguous ownership areas such as `misc`, `old`, `new`, `final`, `v2`, `temp`, `general`, or `common-everything`;
- shared modules that cannot state which code does not belong there;
- directories whose names hide SUT/evaluation, state, or claim ownership.

Required checks:

- repository map or local guidance is updated when a new top-level project area is introduced;
- review can state the responsibility in one sentence.

Expected mechanisms:

- manual-review

Promotion integration:

- local

Minimum claim-support enforcement: claim-bearing code lives in areas with clear ownership.

Failure consequences:

- merge-blocking
- advisory

Review question: what is this module's responsibility, and what does not belong here?

### ENG-HEALTH-ABSTRACTION-001 - Current Justification For Abstractions

Rule revision: `R1`

Governing sources:

- this standard
- `ADR-001 R1`

Scope: non-throwaway implementation abstractions and shared helpers.

Applies when: a change introduces a new shared module, public interface, base abstraction, generic orchestration type, or moves logic from local to shared ownership.

Rule: new abstractions require current justification: repeated concrete pressure, an accepted boundary or contract obligation, testability or conformance need, or an accepted ADR/working assumption. Anticipated future Zoey scope alone is insufficient.

Forbidden shapes:

- broad `engine`, `manager`, `context`, `memory`, `shared`, `common`, or `utils` modules without bounded responsibility;
- abstractions that hide SUT/evaluation ownership or state origin.

Required checks:

- review records the abstraction responsibility and current justification.

Expected mechanisms:

- manual-review

Promotion integration:

- local

Minimum claim-support enforcement: shared abstractions involved in claims have current justification.

Failure consequences:

- merge-blocking
- advisory

Review question: what current pressure justifies this abstraction, and why is a local implementation insufficient?

### ENG-HEALTH-DEPENDENCY-001 - Production Dependency Discipline

Rule revision: `R1`

Governing sources:

- this standard

Scope: production/runtime dependencies and build-critical dependencies.

Applies when: a dependency is added, materially upgraded, or moved into production/runtime scope.

Rule: new production dependencies require current need, why existing standard-library/local/dependency options are insufficient, ownership boundary, runtime/build impact, version/lock impact, and maintenance suitability appropriate to consequence.

Forbidden shapes:

- adding a package because an agent found it convenient;
- adding dependency-driven architecture before local pressure exists;
- bypassing lockfile or reproducibility expectations.

Required checks:

- dependency addition rationale appears in review or local dependency record.

Expected mechanisms:

- manual-review
- static

Promotion integration:

- local
- CI

Minimum claim-support enforcement: claim-bearing code does not depend on unreviewed production dependencies.

Failure consequences:

- merge-blocking
- promotion-blocking

Review question: why is this dependency needed now, and what ownership/maintenance risk does it introduce?

### ENG-HEALTH-REPRO-001 - Reproducible Project Commands

Rule revision: `R1`

Governing sources:

- this standard

Scope: required gates, local commands, CI commands, and documented developer setup.

Applies when: a repo defines or changes quality, test, conformance, build, or governance gates.

Rule: required local gates can be run from a clean checkout through documented repository commands.

Forbidden shapes:

- depending on undocumented global tools, aliases, shell state, or mystery working directories;
- saying a gate exists without a documented command or CI job;
- tests requiring manual environment patches not recorded in repo guidance.

Required checks:

- repo guidance lists exact commands for required gates;
- command docs are updated when gates change.

Expected mechanisms:

- manual-review
- automated-test

Expected test modes:

- contract

Promotion integration:

- local
- CI

Minimum claim-support enforcement: required claim-supporting gates are reproducible from documented commands.

Failure consequences:

- promotion-blocking
- claim-blocking

Review question: can a clean checkout run this gate using documented commands?

### ENG-HEALTH-FAILURE-001 - Failure Transparency

Rule revision: `R1`

Governing sources:

- this standard

Scope: contract checks, conformance gates, SUT/evaluation boundaries, inspection, reporting, and operational helpers.

Applies when: code catches errors, reports conformance status, handles invalid input, or falls back after unexpected failures.

Rule: contract violations and unexpected failures are not silently converted into success, empty results, or fallback behavior without attributable handling.

Forbidden shapes:

- broad catch returning `None`, empty lists, or success status;
- architecture check unavailable but report says pass;
- inspection failed and returns empty relation set as if valid;
- fallback hides violated rule ID or boundary.

Required checks:

- failure paths expose violated contract or residual risk without leaking prohibited evaluation metadata.

Expected mechanisms:

- automated-test
- manual-review

Expected test modes:

- negative
- regression

Promotion integration:

- local
- CI

Minimum claim-support enforcement: claim-supporting checks fail closed and report failure transparently.

Failure consequences:

- merge-blocking
- claim-blocking

Review question: does this failure path preserve the difference between success, absence, invalidity, and unavailable check?

### ENG-HEALTH-DEAD-001 - Dead Code And Throwaway Promotion

Rule revision: `R1`

Governing sources:

- this standard

Scope: non-throwaway implementation code and throwaway artifacts.

Applies when: dead code, prototypes, experiments, or throwaway artifacts are present near non-throwaway implementation.

Rule: dead code is deleted rather than commented out. Throwaway artifacts receive no conformance credit, and promotion into non-throwaway implementation requires normal review and conformance as if newly introduced.

Forbidden shapes:

- non-throwaway code importing throwaway code;
- commented-out implementation bodies retained as pseudo-history;
- prototype code promoted without conformance review.

Required checks:

- review flags throwaway imports and commented-out dead code;
- promotion review applies active rules and tests.

Expected mechanisms:

- static
- manual-review

Expected test modes:

- contract

Promotion integration:

- local

Minimum claim-support enforcement: claim-bearing code does not depend on throwaway code.

Failure consequences:

- merge-blocking
- promotion-blocking

Review question: is this code active, deleted, or intentionally throwaway?

### ENG-HEALTH-TODO-001 - Tracked TODO Identity

Rule revision: `R1`

Governing sources:

- this standard

Scope: TODOs in non-throwaway code.

Applies when: TODO, FIXME, temporary-workaround, or deferred-work markers appear in non-throwaway code.

Rule: TODOs reference a tracked issue, open-question ID, ADR trigger/reconsideration, or stable implementation follow-up ID. A prose reason may accompany the ID but cannot replace it.

Forbidden shapes:

- `TODO: fix later`;
- `TODO: temporary`;
- architecture-bearing TODOs with no owner, trigger, or follow-up identity.

Required checks:

- review flags untracked TODOs in non-throwaway code.

Expected mechanisms:

- static
- manual-review

Promotion integration:

- local

Minimum claim-support enforcement: claim-bearing code has no untracked architecture TODOs.

Failure consequences:

- merge-blocking
- promotion-blocking

Review question: what stable follow-up identity owns this TODO?

### ENG-HEALTH-COMMENT-001 - Useful Comment Discipline

Rule revision: `R1`

Governing sources:

- this standard

Scope: comments in non-throwaway code.

Applies when: comments are added, generated, or used to justify behavior.

Rule: comments explain why, invariants, non-obvious limitations, accepted trade-offs, or consequences of change. Comments do not narrate obvious syntax or duplicate implementation.

Forbidden shapes:

- generated comments such as "loop through items" for obvious code;
- comments that assert conformance without evidence;
- stale comments that contradict active rules.

Required checks:

- review removes or corrects misleading or low-value comments.

Expected mechanisms:

- manual-review

Promotion integration:

- local

Minimum claim-support enforcement: comments used in claims or conformance explanations are accurate.

Failure consequences:

- advisory
- merge-blocking

Review question: does this comment explain an invariant, trade-off, or consequence that code alone does not show?

### ENG-HEALTH-GEN-001 - Generated Artifact Review

Rule revision: `R1`

Governing sources:

- this standard

Scope: AI-generated or tool-generated code, schemas, tests, docs, and project structure.

Applies when: generated artifacts become non-throwaway implementation or governance material.

Rule: generated artifacts are not authoritative and are reviewed before becoming non-throwaway implementation.

Forbidden shapes:

- generated shared DTOs that mix SUT and evaluation fields;
- generated public contracts that become the first authority for ownership boundaries;
- generated documentation that overclaims acceptance, compatibility, or production readiness.

Required checks:

- generated public contracts, shared packages, fixture projections, simulator records, capture records, and inspection surfaces receive explicit review.

Expected mechanisms:

- automated-test
- manual-review

Expected test modes:

- contract
- negative

Promotion integration:

- local

Minimum claim-support enforcement: generated claim-bearing contracts are reviewed against active rules.

Failure consequences:

- merge-blocking
- promotion-blocking

Review question: did generation introduce hidden ownership, state, boundary, or claim assumptions?

### ENG-CLAIM-001 - Claim Domain Separation

Rule revision: `R1`

Governing sources:

- `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md V0.2.17`
- this standard

Scope: docs, tests, reports, traces, demos, README text, and review language.

Applies when: an artifact describes capability, compatibility, evaluation, scoring, acceptance, readiness, or conformance.

Rule: engineering conformance, evaluated behavioral compatibility, and milestone acceptance are separate claim domains.

Forbidden shapes:

- presenting engineering conformance as evaluated behavioral compatibility;
- presenting development traces or conformance tests as formal evaluation evidence;
- claiming milestone acceptance before the applicable acceptance question resolves.

Required checks:

- artifact labels and documentation use claim language that matches their domain;
- compatibility claims trigger the relevant evaluation-record metadata question.

Expected mechanisms:

- static
- manual-review

Expected test modes:

- contract

Promotion integration:

- local
- CI

Minimum claim-support enforcement: claim-bearing artifacts use bounded language and trigger required open questions.

Failure consequences:

- claim-blocking
- promotion-blocking

Review question: which claim domain does this artifact support, and what does it not support?

### ENG-CLAIM-002 - Formal Evaluation Artifact Reservation

Rule revision: `R1`

Governing sources:

- `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md V0.2.17`
- `ADR-004 R3`
- `ADR-005 R2`

Scope: evaluation records, reports, comparisons, and scoring language.

Applies when: artifacts use formal evaluation, scoreability, pass evidence, campaign, acceptance, or milestone-complete language.

Rule: formal evaluation artifacts remain inactive/reserved until their governing open questions and record contracts resolve. Development artifacts and engineering conformance results are not promoted, copied, renamed, or described as formal evaluation evidence.

Forbidden shapes:

- `formal_campaign_record`, `pass_evidence`, `accepted_slice`, `milestone_complete`, or equivalent labels before governing decisions allow them;
- using internal scoring-related evaluation package data to imply final scoreability.

Required checks:

- reports and docs distinguish development artifact, engineering conformance result, and formal evaluation artifact.

Expected mechanisms:

- static
- manual-review

Expected test modes:

- contract

Promotion integration:

- local

Minimum claim-support enforcement: formal-evaluation language is absent or authorized by governing decisions.

Failure consequences:

- claim-blocking

Review question: does this artifact imply formal evaluation evidence before the formal record contract exists?

### ENG-CHANGE-001 - Open Question Trigger Discipline

Rule revision: `R1`

Governing sources:

- this standard

Scope: implementation work that crosses unresolved governance frontiers.

Applies when: implementation introduces or claims a capability, state transition, external operation, derived artifact, user-facing exposure, or compatibility claim that depends on unresolved control.

Rule: implementation stops and re-triages the relevant open question before the first non-throwaway use or claim that depends on an unresolved control.

Forbidden shapes:

- implementing production memory, retrieval, trust-boundary routing, final scoreability, formal evaluation-record metadata, product surfaces, or continuity claims under selected-slice assumptions;
- burying an open-question trigger inside code.

Required checks:

- review asks whether the change triggers `SLICE-005`, `EVAL-004`, `EVAL-005`, `DEP-003`, `MEM-*`, `TRUST-*`, `PROD-*`, `SURF-*`, `CONT-*`, or `LEG-*`.

Expected mechanisms:

- manual-review

Promotion integration:

- local

Minimum claim-support enforcement: triggered open questions are resolved or scoped before dependent claims.

Failure consequences:

- promotion-blocking
- claim-blocking

Review question: does this change depend on an unresolved control or claim frontier?
